# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given **two baskets** and your goal is to put **maximum number of fruits in each basket**. The only restriction is that **each basket can have only one type of fruit**.

# You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. You will pick one
# fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

# Example 1:

# Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']

# Example 2:

# Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
# Output: 5
# Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
# This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
